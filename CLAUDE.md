# McRitchie Studio

Central task management and orchestration hub for the McRitchie AI agent system (Alex, Mack, Mason, Turf Monster).

> **Part of the McRitchie ecosystem.** See [`docs/ECOSYSTEM.md`](docs/ECOSYSTEM.md) for the 5-repo map. This file is the per-repo index — each topic below loads on demand from `docs/topics/`. Original kitchen-sink CLAUDE.md was split on 2026-05-17 per audit Tier 2 #9.

## Quick Reference

- **Dev server**: `bin/rails server` (port 3000). Turf Monster on 3001, Tax Studio on 3003.
- **Tests**: `bin/rails test` (~418 runs). See [`docs/topics/testing.md`](docs/topics/testing.md) for invocation gotchas.
- **Deploy**: `git push heroku main` to `mcritchie-studio` (https://app.mcritchie.studio). See [`docs/topics/deployment.md`](docs/topics/deployment.md).
- **Recovery**: [`docs/agents/system/house-burn-down.md`](docs/agents/system/house-burn-down.md) — full fresh-Mac protocol.
- **Current roadmap**: [`docs/agents/system/ecosystem-audit-2026-05-17.md`](docs/agents/system/ecosystem-audit-2026-05-17.md) — tiered audit.

## Workflow Preferences

- **Debugging**: STOP on bugs — show the issue and ask before fixing
- **Testing**: Write tests alongside features. **Always run `bin/rails test` before committing** — fix failures before creating the commit. A pre-commit hook enforces this, but proactively run tests after changes rather than waiting for the hook.
- **Database**: Migrate and seed freely without asking
- **Git**: Small frequent commits, push immediately. Run `bin/rails test` before every commit — fix failures before committing.
- **UI**: Style as we build using brand palette
- **Decisions**: Present 2-3 options briefly with a recommendation
- **Refactoring**: Proactively clean up code smells

## Session Protocol

When the user signals end of session, review and refactor ALL CLAUDE.md files (and `docs/topics/*.md` since the split) to reflect current state.
