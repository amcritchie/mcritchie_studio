# Coach headshot URL discovery (athlete URLs come from nfl:players_seed via
# nflverse master CSV, not this seed).
#
# - Coaches: HCs from ESPN's v2 coaches API + all 4 roles (HC + 3 coordinators)
#   scraped from each team's NFL.com /team/coaches[-roster]/ page via the
#   TEAM_NFL_SUBDOMAIN map in lib/tasks/nfl.rake.
#
# DB-only — no S3 traffic. Image upload + caching happens in
# bin/rails nfl:upload_coach_headshots (called by /nfl-rebuild Step 5).
#
# Idempotent — re-seeds only update rows whose source URL has changed.
