# Athlete grades — fallback layer for athletes not in any PFF CSV.
#
# By the time this runs:
#   29_pff_grades.rb has imported ~570 real PFF grades for starters/role
#   players. The athletes left here are backups + practice-squad — by definition
#   non-stars without enough snaps for a meaningful PFF grade. They get a flat
#   50.0 placeholder so ranking pages and the player-impact simulator have a
#   value to sort/compute against; depth chart ordering itself comes from
#   ESPN's scraper now (espn:scrape_depth_charts), not from grades.
#
# Prospects keep the tier-based grading with grade_ranges JSONB since draft
# slot is the only signal we have for them pre-NFL.
