# NFL Rebuild — Full Recovery Pipeline

End state: every NFL team has 32 active rosters with starting offense/defense lineups, depth charts, contracts, salaries, grades, and headshots. Idempotent — safe to re-run.

## Preconditions

Confirm before running:

1. **AWS credentials present** for S3 headshot upload. Check with `op item get q6jborl22otitr5y3dzwpbzxa4 --vault txqp6ijdo3ujsfhsfzdj5h5dzq --field "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" --reveal | head -c 4`. Should print 4 chars of the access key. If empty, headshots will be skipped (Athletes still seed; re-run with creds later).
2. **Postgres running**: `pg_isready` returns `accepting connections`.
3. **ImageMagick installed**: `which magick` returns a path. If missing, `brew install imagemagick`.
4. **Working tree clean**: `git status --short` is empty (so seed log noise can be reverted easily if anything goes sideways).

If any precondition fails, stop and report — don't try to continue.

## Pipeline

Run each step and report results before moving to the next. If a step fails, stop. Don't skip ahead.

### Step 1 — Reset the database

```bash
op run --env-file=/Users/alex/projects/.env -- bin/rails db:drop db:create db:schema:load
```

This drops + recreates the DB and loads the current schema (faster and safer than running every migration). Confirms with no errors when fresh.

### Step 2 — Run the standard seed pipeline

Logs to file because seed output contains emoji + scraped strings that crash Claude Code over JSON.

```bash
op run --env-file=/Users/alex/projects/.env -- bin/rails db:seed > tmp/seed.log 2>&1
echo "exit: $?"
tail -40 tmp/seed.log
```

This populates: 32 NFL teams + 71 NCAA + 48 FIFA, 128 coaches, 3 seasons, 29 slates, ~2,400 Spotrac contracts, prospects, PFF grades, synthetic grade fill, depth chart shells, sample roster spots, news/content/tasks fixtures.

### Step 3 — Pull nflverse master CSV (identity + cross-ref IDs + headshots)

Fetches `players.csv` (~24k rows), filters to active players from 2024+, upserts Athletes with all five cross-ref IDs (`gsis_id`, `pff_id`, `otc_id`, `pfr_id`, `nflverse_id`), then caches ESPN headshots to S3.

```bash
op run --env-file=/Users/alex/projects/.env -- bin/rails nfl:players_seed > tmp/players_seed.log 2>&1
echo "exit: $?"
tail -20 tmp/players_seed.log
```

Expect: ~2,500 athletes upserted, ~1,500 headshots cached (ESPN has IDs for most current players). Takes ~10-25 min depending on network. The two known dead links (`sal-cannella`, `isaiah-bond`) log a `[!]` and continue.

### Step 3.5 — Merge duplicate Persons

`db:seed` (Spotrac, prospects) creates Persons with suffix-stripped names ("Will Anderson") while `nfl:players_seed` keeps the canonical "Will Anderson Jr." with all the cross-ref IDs. ID-first lookup prevents NEW collisions but pre-existing seed-induced duplicates are still floating around with their own contracts and depth chart entries. This step consolidates them into the canonical record.

```bash
op run --env-file=/Users/alex/projects/.env -- bin/rails nfl:merge_duplicate_athletes DRY_RUN=0 > tmp/merge.log 2>&1
echo "exit: $?"
tail -5 tmp/merge.log
```

Expect: ~20-60 pairs merged on a fresh build. Idempotent — re-running on a clean DB finds 0 pairs. Conflicts (duplicate Contract for the same team, etc.) are dropped in favor of the canonical row.

### Step 4 — ESPN depth-chart scrape

Auto-creates DepthChart shells per team, places players per ESPN's published depth, creates Contracts for any active-roster players not yet in the DB (UDFAs, mid-season call-ups), expires stale contracts when players have moved teams.

```bash
op run --env-file=/Users/alex/projects/.env -- bin/rails espn:scrape_depth_charts > tmp/espn_scrape.log 2>&1
echo "exit: $?"
tail -25 tmp/espn_scrape.log
```

Expect: 32 teams scraped, ~2,000 athletes matched, ~200 positions reconciled, some Contracts created/expired/revived as the scrape catches up to current rosters.

### Step 5 — Headshot backfill (athletes + coaches)

Step 3 (nfl:players_seed) only caches headshots for athletes who appear in nflverse's `status=ACT, last_season>=2024` filter. Step 4 may add Contracts (and `Athlete.team_slug`) for ESPN-listed players outside that filter (practice-squad call-ups, recently-cut players still on rosters). And `db:seed` only LINKS coach `espn_headshot_url` (via 32_headshot_links.rb), it doesn't upload them.

This step closes both gaps.

**Athletes** — uploads any Athlete with `espn_id` + `team_slug` but no cached variants:

```bash
op run --env-file=/Users/alex/projects/.env -- bin/rails nfl:upload_headshots > tmp/headshot_backfill.log 2>&1
echo "exit: $?"
tail -10 tmp/headshot_backfill.log
```

**Coaches** — uploads any Coach with `espn_headshot_url` (set by db:seed) but no cached variants:

```bash
op run --env-file=/Users/alex/projects/.env -- bin/rails nfl:upload_coach_headshots > tmp/coach_backfill.log 2>&1
echo "exit: $?"
tail -8 tmp/coach_backfill.log
```

Expect: ~300-400 athletes newly cached + ~150 coaches (HC always, OC/DC/STC where NFL.com scrape captured a URL). Both tasks are idempotent.

### Step 5c — Compute proprietary Pass/Run grades

Reads the `*_grade_pff` columns (set by `db/seeds/29_pff_grades.rb` during Step 2) and writes `position_pass_rank` / `position_pass_grade` / `position_run_rank` / `position_run_grade` on each `AthleteGrade`. Without this step the P/R letter-grade badges on `/games/.../show` and `/nfl-team-grades/:team_slug` render empty (`—`).

```bash
op run --env-file=/Users/alex/projects/.env -- bin/rails nfl:assign_grades > tmp/assign_grades.log 2>&1
echo "exit: $?"
tail -3 tmp/assign_grades.log
```

Expect: a stats hash like `proprietary grades: {qb=>~80, rb=>~150, wr_te=>~500, ol=>~460, dl=>~590, lb=>~210, db=>~350}` (sizes vary with PFF coverage). Pure DB compute, runs in seconds. Idempotent — re-runs overwrite prior values.

## Verification

```bash
op run --env-file=/Users/alex/projects/.env -- bin/rails runner '
  puts "Teams (NFL):     #{Team.where(league: "nfl").count}"
  puts "Athletes:        #{Athlete.where(sport: "football").count}"
  puts "  with espn_id:  #{Athlete.where.not(espn_id: nil).count}"
  puts "  with gsis_id:  #{Athlete.where.not(gsis_id: nil).count}"
  puts "  with team_slug:#{Athlete.where.not(team_slug: nil).count}"
  puts "Contracts:       #{Contract.where(contract_type: "active").count}"
  puts "DepthCharts:     #{DepthChart.count}"
  puts "DepthChartEntries:#{DepthChartEntry.count}"
  puts "ImageCaches:     #{ImageCache.where(purpose: "headshot").count}"
  puts "AthleteGrades:   #{AthleteGrade.count}"
  puts "  prop pass set: #{AthleteGrade.where.not(position_pass_grade: nil).count}"
  puts "  prop run set:  #{AthleteGrade.where.not(position_run_grade: nil).count}"
'
```

Healthy targets:
- Teams (NFL): 32
- Athletes: 2,000–3,000 (filter is `last_season >= 2024`)
- with team_slug: ≥ 2,000 (most active players placed)
- Contracts active: ≥ 2,400 (Spotrac stars + ESPN-added backups)
- DepthCharts: 32
- DepthChartEntries: ~2,500
- ImageCaches: ~5,000 (athletes × 3 variants when headshots ran)

## Visual smoke test

Open `http://localhost:3000/nfl-rosters` and confirm each team renders 12 offensive starters, 12 defensive starters, 4 special teams, 4 coaches with headshots. Spot-check 3–4 teams across divisions.

## Recovery if something goes wrong

- Step 2 fails partway: `bin/rails db:reset > tmp/seed.log 2>&1` re-runs the whole seed (idempotent). Inspect `tmp/seed.log` for the failing record.
- Step 3 fails on headshot upload: re-run — idempotent, only missing variants are uploaded. Or `SKIP_HEADSHOTS=1 bin/rails nfl:players_seed` to skip headshot calls entirely if AWS is the issue.
- Step 4 fails on a single team: `bin/rails espn:scrape_depth_charts TEAM=buf` to retry one team. ESPN occasionally rate-limits — wait a minute and retry.
